# rock-paper-scissors
This project is a simple yet functional implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors, built using JavaScript. It originally ran in the browser console, but has since been updated with a basic DOM-based interface. The game includes interactive buttons, score tracking, and a display that announces the winner of each round and the overall game.

## Objectives
- Apply problem-solving strategies by planning with pseudocode
- Practice JavaScript fundamentals such as:
    - Variables
    - Functions
    - Conditionals
    - Random value generation using Math.random()
    - DOM manipulation (in updated version)

## Features (Updated Version)
- Interactive buttons for Rock, Paper, and Scissors
- Dynamic DOM updates to:
    - Show current scores
    - Display round outcomes
    - Announce the final winner once a player reaches 5 points
- 


## Key Topics Learned
While working on this project, I learned the importance of writing pseudocode first to organize my thoughts and plan out the logic before diving into the actual code. This helped me stay focused and approach the problem more clearly. I also practiced using console.log() and the browser's developer tools to test and debug each part of my code, which made it easier to catch and fix issues early. Updating the project to use the DOM gave me hands-on practice with event listeners, manipulating HTML elements, and creating responsive behavior. I realized during this project that I need to commit my code to GitHub more often, and that’s something I’m going to actively work on in future projects to improve my version control habits. Most importantly, I learned how to break a larger problem into smaller, manageable steps, which made the overall process feel more achievable and less overwhelming.
