# rock-paper-scissors
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock Paper Scissors using only JavaScript. The game runs entirely in the browser console, with no graphical user interface (GUI)

## Objectives
- Apply problem-solving strategies by planning with pseudocode
- Practice JavaScript fundamentals such as:
    - Variables
    - Functions
    - Conditionals
    - User input using prompt()
    - Random value generation using Math.random()

## Key Topics Learned
While working on this project, I learned the importance of writing pseudocode first to organize my thoughts and plan out the logic before diving into the actual code. This helped me stay focused and approach the problem more clearly. I also practiced using console.log() and the browser's developer tools to test and debug each part of my code, which made it easier to catch and fix issues early. I realized during this project that I need to commit my code to GitHub more often, and that’s something I’m going to actively work on in future projects to improve my version control habits. Most importantly, I learned how to break a larger problem into smaller, manageable steps, which made the overall process feel more achievable and less overwhelming.
